# hello-world
first project let's start.

Hello everyone!

I want to learn how to code and have fun at the same time.
Have experienced how difficult to make programs from college days, I would like to learn this subject without time constrain.
I have full time job and busy but always wanted to learn coding if i have spare time.
Thanks for such a greate web site so that I can learn at my own speed without time management stress.
Let see how far I can get!
